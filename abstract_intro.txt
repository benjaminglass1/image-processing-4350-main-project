Abstract: 
  We have been tasked with performing image restoration of a color image that has had some noise added to it.
During this project we will explore the advantages and disadvantages of using the different color models in this process. 
The first task involves adding noise to the given image and then using our prior knowledge of the noise to perform the restoration 
of the image. The second task involves using the HSI model to filter the color components of the image before converting back to 
the RGB color space. Then we will explain the concepts that we used during this process along with displaying our results.

Intro: 
  The purpose of this image processing project is to perform image restoration on a given color image. This group project was 
assigned by our Image Processing teacher Dr. Ambrose Ononye to help us gain a better understanding of the image restoration 
concepts that were taught during class. We will be limited to using a programming language called Matlab and its built-in 
functions for all our image processing tasks. 
  Color is a powerful tool that we as humans use to describe and identify objects. We can discern many more shades of color, 
compared to the couple of shades of gray that we see.  Because of this color image processing has a wide variety of applications.  
Being able to differentiate between these colors is key when trying to understand or convey information using images. Brightness, 
hue, and saturation are the properties that we use to describe how we see and differentiate between different colors. 
  Taking advantage of the different color models helps to facilitate the image restoration.
process. By having prior knowledge of the noise, we apply two color models, HSI and RGB. In this project we manipulated the 
properties of these color models to restore an image. The color modelsâ€™ channels are furthermore split and processed individually 
to produce the desired result.
