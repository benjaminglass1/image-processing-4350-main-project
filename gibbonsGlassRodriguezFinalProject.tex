%	The Abstract	should contain:
%	First and foremostly: The information required to quickly inform somebody :
%					whether or not 
%			Reading your paper is a waste of their time.
%
%	Any related information that would benefit someone who reads your document
%	Any topics covered within the document and to what level the contents are written
%		such as for the benefit of:
%		students, researchers, professors, engineers, professionals
%
%		MOST IMPORTANTLY OF ALL:

%				2. Voltage Drop relationship to conductivity
%			such as Principles of Logical Definition
%				1. AND includes both terms completely
%				2. OR includes at least one term
%				3. eXclusive-OR (XOR) includes ONLY one term
%				4. NOT is true only if the formentioned term is not present
%			and maybe including such in binary terms of 0's & 1's.

The theory behind this project is four fold:\\
\indent 
1) Inspecting the Gaussian Noise Model .\\
\indent
2) Exegesis on RGB image structure (Red, Green, \& Blue). \\
\indent
3) The application of HSI Color Model Extrapolation (RGB to Hue, Saturation, \& Intensity).\\
\indent
4) The utility of Adaptive Noise Reduction.

\subsection*{Gaussian Noise Model}
\noindent
The Gaussian Noise Model is a practical way of simulating noise in many circumstances across many fields.\\
\hfill \\
It is derived from the Gaussian Statistical Model, shown in the following equation as well as figure:\\
\[ \scalebox{2}{$ $\qquad \qquad \quad$
pdf(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \cdot \pi}} e^{\frac{1}{2}\big(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\big)^{2}} $\qquad \qquad \quad (1)$
$}\]

\end{figure}

\pagebreak
\noindent
Gaussian Noise may take place via overlapping signals that are themselves transmitted in any mode similar to
oscillating sinusoidal signals, and may generate white noise.  This is form of white noise taught to University 
Physics II students with Gaussian spectrum distribution curves spanning the spectrum of visible light.  Normally 
with Red, Green, and Blue Gaussian spectrum distributions overlapping each other.\\
\hfill \\
Gaussian Noise may further be understood as sensor/signal perturbations that oscillate about the mean or true,
desired value.  This perturbation creates an effect whereby the most likely events are the central points of oscillation
unto the effect that the mean is the most likely actual signal.  Hence, one may achieve this effect by applying a 
Gaussian Noise Filter over the signal.\\
\hfill \\
However, the particular Gaussian Noise applied in this project is that across a two dimensional matrix, namely: a
photograph or image.

\subsection*{RGB Image Structure}

RGB is an acronym for the Red, Green, and Blue Color Model.\\

%\section{Procedure}

%	The Procedure should contain all necessary actions in order to acheive your result

\pagebreak

\section{Methodology}

%	The Methodology should contain but may not be limited to:
%		The general method that is applied to each portion of the procedure.
%		Any techniques applied to obtain the results achieved
%		Point to discussion if there were attempted techniques that failed to achieve the desired result
%			and were not used to obtain your final results.
%		THEN discuss their implications in the Discussion Section
%
%	The Methodology may also include a ``Calculations Section'' 
%		wherein, one demonstrates the calculation processes required to obtain the desired results.
%		This section may be used to present calculations and referred back to in the results section when 
%		being cited.
%




\pagebreak

\section{Results}

%	The Results includes the final results of any calculations, images, or experiments
%	The Results should have very limited elaboration::
%			Let the Results Speak for Themselves
%		Otherwise,
%			Compile your results so that they are more easily understood
%	Save any deep inspection for the discussion
%


\pagebreak

\section{Discussion}

%	See all the above and use your imagination
%
%

\pagebreak

\section{Conclusion}

%	The conclusion should be a concise summary of the results and discussion.
%
%	The conclusion should assert whether or not you accomplished the goal of the experiment
%	and with what margins or error and uncertainty.
